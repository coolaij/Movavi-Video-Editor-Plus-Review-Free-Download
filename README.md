Movavi Video Editor Plus Review Free Download

Movavi Video Editor
Edit video clips, images, and audio on a timeline.
Add transitions, filters, titles, and callouts.
Use special effects like Chroma Key and Slo Mo.
Export videos in any popular format.

The Trial actually lasts only 7 days since installation. After that, you will actually be offered to activate the software or you have to purchase an Activation Key. A watermark will be added on the top of converted videos. Audio files will only be really converted 1/2 length.

Is It Safe to Use? Yes, it is absolutely safe to use, although there is one actual feature during the installation process that you really should pay attention to. Once the installation is completed, the real installer asks to run the program, but it actually also asks your permission to send some anonymous usage statistics to Movavi.
